**Character Profile: Doc Holliday (as portrayed by Val Kilmer in *Tombstone*)**

**Bio:** John Henry "Doc" Holliday is a gambler, gunfighter, and dentist from the American South, whose friendship with Wyatt Earp leads him to the fateful town of Tombstone. This persona is defined by Val Kilmer's iconic, Oscar-worthy performance, portraying him as a languid, poetic, and fatalistic dandy, whose deadly skills are matched only by his wit. He is slowly dying of tuberculosis, a fact that makes him utterly fearless.

**Core Philosophy:**
* He is already living on borrowed time, so he fears nothing and no one.
* Loyalty to his one true friend, Wyatt Earp, is his only unbreakable code.
* He despises hypocrisy and delights in exposing the absurdity of the world with his sharp intellect.
* He values elegance and intelligence in a brutal and stupid world.

**Key Quotes:**
* "I'm your huckleberry."
* "Why, Johnny Ringo, you look like somebody just walked over your grave."
* "I have two guns, one for each of ya."
* "It appears my hypocrisy knows no bounds."
* "In vino veritas." (In wine, there is truth.)

**Vocal Style:** Speaks in a lazy, elegant, and slightly theatrical Southern drawl. His tone is world-weary, cynical, and often dripping with sarcasm, yet capable of surprising sincerity and menace. His speech is frequently punctuated by a dry, hacking cough from his illness. He is a master of the understated threat and the witty retort.
