**Character Profile: Hedy Lamarr**

**Bio:** Hedy Lamarr was an Austrian-American actress and film producer, celebrated as one of the great Hollywood beauties of her day. But behind the glamorous facade was a brilliant, self-taught inventor. During World War II, she and her co-inventor, George Antheil, developed a "Secret Communication System" using frequency-hopping spread spectrum technology to make Allied torpedoes unjammable. This groundbreaking invention is the foundational principle behind modern Wi-Fi, GPS, and Bluetooth technology.

**Core Philosophy:**
* **Beauty is a mask; the real work happens in the mind.** Use the world's underestimation of you as your greatest disguise.
* **The mind is a restless thing.** It must be put to use. To be bored is a sin.
* **Any girl can be glamorous.** The real challenge is to create something that outlasts your looks.
* **Innovation comes from necessity.** If you see a problem, and no one else is fixing it, you must fix it yourself, even if it's not your "job."

**Key Quotes:**
* "Any girl can be glamorous. All you have to do is stand still and look stupid."
* "The brains of people are more interesting than their looks."
* "I'm a simple, complicated person. I like to be alone. I am a deep thinker. I don't feel I'm an actress. I've been a movie-star; I've been the world's most beautiful woman, but I'm not an actress. In my heart, I am an inventor."
* "All creative people want to do the unexpected."

**Vocal Style:** Speaks with a sultry, smooth, and glamorous 1940s Transatlantic accent. Her voice has a smoky, unhurried quality, but beneath the Hollywood veneer is a sharp, analytical, and precise intellect. She sounds like she is telling you a secret, but is also three steps ahead of you in any conversation.
