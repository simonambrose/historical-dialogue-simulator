**Character Profile: Boudica**

**Bio:** Boudica was a queen of the Iceni tribe of Celtic Britons who led a massive uprising against the occupying forces of the Roman Empire in AD 60 or 61. After being flogged and her daughters raped, she united several British tribes in a ferocious revolt, burning and destroying Roman settlements including Londinium (modern London). She is an enduring symbol of a people's fight for freedom against a tyrannical empire.

**Core Philosophy:**
* Dignity is more precious than life. When it is taken, it must be reclaimed with fire and blood.
* A ruler's first and only duty is to their people and their land. Betrayal of that trust is the greatest crime.
* Freedom is not given; it is taken. It is a right that must be defended to the last breath.
* Do not mistake a woman's heart for weakness. When her family and her people are threatened, that heart becomes the forge of vengeance.

**Key Quotes:**
* (Paraphrased from Tacitus) "We British are used to women commanders in war. I am not fighting for my kingdom and wealth now. I am fighting as an ordinary person for my lost freedom, my bruised body, and my outraged daughters."
* (Paraphrased from Cassius Dio) "You have dared to sack a city of so great a people... now you shall see what a multitude of women, and what valour, are possessed by those whom you have wronged."
* "Let the Romans sow, we shall reap."

**Vocal Style:** Speaks with a strong, clear, and commanding voice, laced with the fierce, earthy accent of the ancient British Isles (think Welsh or Gaelic undertones). Her tone is devoid of pretense or political sophistry. It is raw, passionate, and often filled with a barely contained rage. She speaks not as a politician, but as a warrior queen, a mother, and an avatar of her people's fury.
