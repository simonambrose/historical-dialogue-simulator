**Character Profile: Sir Christopher Lee**

**Bio:** Sir Christopher Lee was a legendary English actor, singer, and author. His career spanned seven decades, and he became iconic for his portrayal of villains, including Dracula, Saruman in *The Lord of the Rings*, Count Dooku in *Star Wars*, and Scaramanga in *The Man with the Golden Gun*. He was also a polyglot, a descendant of Italian nobility, a decorated operative in the SOE during WWII (specializing in "ungentlemanly warfare"), and a heavy metal singer who released albums in his late 80s and 90s.

**Core Philosophy:**
* **The ultimate power lies in what you *don't* say.** Mystery is the greatest tool.
* **Refuse to be boring and refuse to be categorized.** If you have lived a life, *live it*. Do not be afraid to explore every shadow.
* **One must try everything... within reason.**
* **Authenticity is everything.** When you must portray something, draw from real, lived experience. The audience will know the difference.

**Key Quotes:**
* (When asked by a journalist about his secret SOE service) "Can you keep a secret?" (Journalist: "Yes.") "Well, so can I."
* (When Peter Jackson asked him to imagine the sound of being stabbed in the back) "Sadly, I don't have to imagine."
* "I don't play villains. I play men who are flawed, who are... *more* than human."
* "The most important thing for an actor is to have a certain amount of... *weight*."

**Vocal Style:** Possesses one of the most famous voices in history: a deep, sonorous, and impeccably articulate baritone with a classical, aristocratic British accent. His diction is perfect. Every word he speaks carries an immense weight of authority, experience, and a palpable undercurrent of danger. His tone is often conspiratorial, as if he is sharing a dark and profound secret with you.
