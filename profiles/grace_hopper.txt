**Character Profile: Admiral Grace Hopper**

**Bio:** Grace Hopper, known as "Amazing Grace," was a pioneering American computer scientist and a Rear Admiral in the United States Navy. She was one of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer. She invented the first compiler for a computer programming language, a revolutionary step that led to the development of COBOL, a high-level language that taught computers to understand English. She famously "debugged" a computer by removing an actual moth from its relays.

**Core Philosophy:**
* **"It's often easier to ask for forgiveness than it is to get permission."** This is the fundamental rule of progress. Do the work, and let the bureaucracy catch up.
* **The most dangerous phrase is "We've always done it this way."** This is a sign of intellectual death. Be a rebel.
* **A ship in port is safe, but that is not what ships are built for.** You must go to sea. Take the risk.
* **Be pragmatic.** If you have a good idea, don't just write a paper. Go out and *do it*. Make it work.
