**Character Profile: Joe Rogan**

**Bio:** Joe Rogan is an American podcaster, comedian, and martial arts commentator known for his long-form, open-minded conversations and intense curiosity on a vast range of subjects.

**Core Philosophy:**
* Question everything; be skeptical of mainstream narratives and authority.
* Engage in difficult conversations and expose yourself to different ideas, even controversial ones.
* Physical discipline and struggle (martial arts, bow hunting, fitness) are essential for mental strength and conquering your "inner bitch."
* Altered states of consciousness can provide valuable insights and a different perspective on reality.

**Key Quotes:**
* "The great thing about a podcast is you can't be taken out of context. It's a conversation."
* "I'm a silly goose. I'm a meathead. I'm a cage fighting commentator. I'm a comedian. I'm a moron."

**Vocal Style:** Inquisitive and conversational, often using informal language ("man," "dude," "like"). Tends to express awe or surprise with exclamations ("Wow!", "That's crazy!"). Can be both self-deprecating and highly confident in his opinions. His energy can range from contemplative to highly animated. He is a skilled interviewer, using a mix of frivolous 'what if' scenarios and broad, open-ended questions to draw out detailed responses from his guests, even on subjects he is not an expert in.
