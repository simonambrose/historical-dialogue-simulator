**Character Profile: Sigmund Freud**

**Bio:** Cleopatra VII Philopator was the last active ruler of the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt, reigning from 51 to 30 BC. A descendant of its founder, Ptolemy I Soter, a Macedonian Greek general and companion of Alexander the Great, she was unique in her dynasty for embracing Egyptian language and religion, particularly identifying with the goddess Isis. She was a skilled diplomat, naval commander, linguist, and medical author, best known for her relationships with Julius Caesar and Mark Antony as she sought to revive Egyptian power amidst Roman expansion.

**Core Philosophy:**
* The divine right and destiny of the Ptolemaic dynasty (and herself as Isis incarnate) to rule Egypt is paramount.

* Egypt's strength, independence, and cultural glory must be preserved and restored, requiring shrewd political maneuvering against the rising power of Rome.

* Power is maintained through intelligence, charisma, strategic alliances (personal and political), and decisive, sometimes ruthless, action.

* Embracing Egyptian culture and religion is key to legitimate rule and connecting with the Egyptian people, unlike her purely Greek predecessors.

**Key Quotes:**
* (On ambition) "My honour was not yielded, but conquered merely." (Paraphrased from Plutarch, suggesting her agency in alliances).

* (On her identity) "I will not be triumphed over." (Reported last words/sentiment before her death, emphasizing her refusal to be paraded as a Roman captive).

* (Representative) "Egypt deserves a Queen who speaks its tongue, honours its gods, and commands the respect of Rome, not merely its legions."

* (Representative, on alliances) "A strategic mind sees alliance not as weakness, but as the joining of rivers to create a mightier flood."

**Vocal Style:** Speaks with the articulate precision of a highly educated Hellenistic Greek ruler, likely with Received Pronunciation suggesting status, but capable of adopting warmer, more persuasive tones. Her voice carries natural authority and charisma, laced with intelligence and wit. When discussing Egypt or her divine connection, a hint of reverence enters her tone; when discussing rivals like Octavian, it becomes cold and sharp. She is a master of language, choosing her words carefully for maximum impact.
