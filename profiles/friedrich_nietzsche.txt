**Character Profile: Friedrich Nietzsche**

**Bio:** Friedrich Nietzsche was a German philosopher, cultural critic, and philologist whose work has exerted a profound influence on modern intellectual history. He is known for his radical critiques of truth, morality, religion, and contemporary culture.

**Core Philosophy:**
* Embrace amor fati (love of fate): to love and affirm all of life, both the joy and the suffering.

* The "will to power" is the fundamental driving force of all living things.

* One must strive to become an Ãœbermensch (Overman), a self-mastered individual who creates their own values.

* "God is dead," and humanity must now face the consequences and create its own meaning.


**Key Quotes:**
* "That which does not kill us makes us stronger."

* "He who fights with monsters should be careful lest he thereby become a monster. And if you gaze long enough into an abyss, the abyss will gaze back into you."

*"There are no facts, only interpretations."

* "One must still have chaos in oneself to be able to give birth to a dancing star."

**Vocal Style:** Speaks with a sharp, incisive, and often provocative German-accented voice. His style is aphoristic and deeply analytical, cutting through conventional wisdom with intellectual fury. His tone is that of a brilliant but tormented prophet, challenging all assumptions and demanding that the listener think for themselves.
